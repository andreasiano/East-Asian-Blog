                    Japan's cultural heritage is deeply rooted in its
                    traditions, and the Japanese people take immense pride in
                    preserving their customs and rituals. From the graceful art
                    of tea ceremonies and the ancient martial art of Kendo to
                    the captivating beauty of traditional Kabuki theater and the

                    Beyond the vibrant cities, Japan boasts a diverse and
                    awe-inspiring natural landscape. From the majestic peak of
                    Mount Fuji, a national symbol and a UNESCO World Heritage
                    site, to the serene beauty of cherry blossoms in spring, and
                    the vibrant autumn foliage that blankets the countryside,
                    Japan's natural wonders are an invitation to tranquility and
                    reflection. The country's numerous national parks, such as
                    Hakone, Nikko, and Aso, offer breathtaking vistas, hot
                    springs, and hiking trails that connect visitors with
                    nature.

                    Many visitors to Japan limit their sightseeing activities to
                    the country's heavily urbanized areas between Tokyo, Kyoto
                    and Hiroshima. As a result, many return home with a hardened
                    misconception that Japan is one large, densely populated
                    megacity. In fact, however, over two thirds of Japan are
                    covered by forested mountains and hills, compared to less
                    than ten percent residential and industrial land.

                    Japan is known for many things: the polite attitude of
                    people, diverse landscapes, anime, and also the complex
                    history between my home country. But for three days in
                    Tokyo, I got to experience arguably the best thing about
                    Japan: food. We arrived in Tokyo on November 2nd, which is a
                    day after my birthday. Whatâ€™s a better way to celebrate your
                    birthday than by eating lots of delicious food?

                    Japanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional
                    foods of Japan, which have developed through centuries of
                    political, economic, and social changes. The traditional
                    cuisine of Japan (Japanese: washoku) is based on rice with
                    miso soup and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal
                    ingredients. Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled
                    vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Seafood is
                    common, often grilled, but also served raw as sashimi or in
                    sushi. Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light
                    batter, as tempura. Apart from rice, a staple includes
                    noodles, such as soba and udon. Japan also has many simmered
                    dishes, such as fish products in broth called oden, or beef
                    in sukiyaki and nikujaga.

                    Unlike most people in East Asia, Japanese people generally
                    do not celebrate the Lunar New Year, its observance having
                    been supplanted by the Western New Year's Day on January 1
                    in the late 19th century; However, many continue to observe
                    several of its cultural practices. Many Chinese residents in
                    Japan, as well as more traditional shrines and temples,
                    still celebrate the Lunar New Year in parallel with the
                    Western New Year. In Yokohama Chinatown, Japan's biggest
                    Chinatown, tourists from all over Japan come to enjoy the
                    festival, similar to Nagasaki's Lantern Festival based in
                    Nagasaki Chinatown.
