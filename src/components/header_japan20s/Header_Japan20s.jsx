                With the arrival of Captain Perry’s black ships in 1868, the
                Tokugawa shogunate ended its prolonged policy of isolationism.
                After that date, Japan underwent a stunning transformation,
                turning into a “modernized country”. Before specifying these
                radical changes, it is important to analyze what came before. In
                the 1600s Japan was under the rule of a despotic figure, the
                shogun. Emerging from the chaos of the Sengoku period, the
                Tokugawa shogunate, also known as the Edo shogunate, established
                an enduring samurai government known as (bakufu).

                The Edo period was characterized by economic growth, strict
                social and hierarchical order based on Confucianism, and popular
                enjoyment of arts and culture. The Edo shoguns, to prevent any
                sort of rise against them, established several policies such as
                the “alternate attendance system”. This system required daimyo,
                feudal lords under the Shogun’s control, to divide their time
                between the capital of their domain and Edo.
              </p>
              <p class="h5 mt-3 mb-5 custom-paragraph-article">
                During the years that warlords returned home, their families
                remained in the capital as hostages. If daimyo had tried to
                attack the bakufu, the consequences would have been dangerous
                for their families. This strategy ensured everlasting peace for
                the Shogunate. Regarding contacts with the outside world, as we
                can deduce, they were profoundly reduced. After outlawing
                Christianity, the Japanese only permitted trade with Dutch,
                Chinese, Koreans, and Okinawans on the island of Deshima. This
                lasted until the second half of the 19th century, clearing the
                way for the Meiji Restoration.

                By the early 19th century, those policies that had worked well
                in the Edo shogunate ended up as old-fashioned, becoming a
                source of problems for the country. Middle-ranked samurai were
                frustrated because of their exclusion from higher positions in
                government.

                Meanwhile, chonin(merchants), who started to be the main
                characters in the previous period, thanks to the increased

                seemed to contradict what was a hierarchical system based on
                classes, where samurai had much more power. People started to
                question the Tokugawa government, moving closer to a possible
                change. All of this was also allowed by the pressures of Western
                powers to finally open Japan to the world.

                The bakufu was unable to turn them away. After signing a

                tariff rates to foreign powers, in 1860 samurai particularly
                those lower of rank took advantage of the bakufu weakness, by
                destroying it. They founded a new government to eliminate class

                The Meiji period was characterized by the restoration of the
                ancient line of Japanese emperors, and powerless figures in the
                Tokugawa shogunate. To favor the country’s unification, the
                emperor's leading advisors, primarily samurai who had become
                ministers of state, abolished the warlords' domains and the
                previous hierarchical class system. Among these reforms, all
                Japanese people were declared equal citizens, the government
                required children to attend elementary school and young men
                started to serve in the military.

                Such beliefs were further strengthened by the state sponsorship
                of the Shinto faith, which taught that the emperors were
                descendants of the sun goddess Amaterasu. The Meiji leaders also
                believed that they needed to become more like the Western
                imperial powers if they hoped to maintain their independence.
                Japan had to learn from the West. The only way was to send
                diplomats around the world to observe other countries' politics.
                As a consequence, Japan hired some foreign advisors to help them
                train in various aspects of “modern life”.

                started changing their appearance by wearing European
                coat-and-tails. This was even true for the emperor himself.
                Photographs showed him wearing western military uniform. All of

                disrupt the social order. Harsh working conditions in factories
                and agricultural industries led people to question the

                vibrant middle class. More and more people were living in cities
                and suburbs by the 1920s. Cars and buses allowed people to move
                rapidly to work. The term “middle class” was never defined
                precisely. Scholars tried to refer to a big group of people, in
                the middle of a social hierarchy, where income, social status,
                and education assume crucial importance. Regarding social status

                As more married women entered the workforce, dual-career
                couples, who succeeded in their profession while raising their
                children, started being valorized. These new women could finally
                pursue their careers and cultivate their talents. The “Taisho
                supermom” had been introduced, capable of balancing the demands
                of a career with household commitments. This new social model
                encouraged the “genuinely free development of the individual”
                leading Japan to be considered as much as Western powers.

                Between the 1910s and 1920s, most of the professionals worked
                downtown in the Marunouchi, Ginza and Kasumigaseki districts.
                The Kasumigaseki area rose to prominence. The government built
                new buildings to house the Supreme Court and other bureaucratic
                agencies. The Marunouchi district instead, emerged as a center
                of big businesses, leading to the construction of the world’s
                largest office complex, the Marunouchi building.

                Ginza became the main center of banking and retailing,
                attracting middle class men and women as a workforce. Regarding
                new architectural trends, the bunka jutaku, or “culture house”
                spread, referring to an idealized two storied house structure
                adorned with both Japanese and Western styles. Flower boxes,
                colored roof tiles and fixed windows replaced traditional
                sliding doors and partitions, but on the inside, the residence
                usually included a wooden-floored reception and a tatami room
                where the family could gather together in the evening.

                Mother and father mostly slept on futon. The bedroom also
                included a traditional tokonoma, an alcove, where a vase or a
                hanging scroll could be displayed. Electric lamps spread and
                fans made summer even more bearable. Electricity also gave much
                more pleasure to housewives, who for the first time dealt with
                electric burners and even refrigerators.

                New forms of recreation
              </h1>
              <p class="h5 custom-paragraph-article">
                By the Taisho years the new middle class popularized new forms
                of recreations. Families often huddled together around a low
                table in a cozy tatami, hearing the evening news from radio
                stations ( the first one began operation in 1925 ) or listening
                to Western classical music. Interesting was the use of modern
                public transportations. Passengers boarded Tokyo’s electric
                trolleys and taxi cabs cruised city streets from 1912. New
                diversions drew middle class families to the city centre. At
                Hibiya park children did wheelies on bicycles, while couples
                wandered, pausing to admire ponds with water-spewing cranes.

              <p class="h5 custom-paragraph-article">
                The middle-class also enjoyed hanging out with friends.
                Youngsters could relax at jazz clubs, admire art galleries or
                simply go to the theater, where dramas by Japanese and Western
                playwrights were staged. Even productions of Western grand opera
                were performed such as The Magic Flute and Carmen. Speaking of
                sports, many joined tennis clubs. These became places where
                people could socialize and make new friends. Entrepreneurs
                started wintertime businesses and as a consequence ski areas
                opened. While swimming at ocean beaches prompted businessmen to
                open boardwalks, refreshment booths and other attractions.{" "}

                On the contrary, middle class adults and families were easy to
