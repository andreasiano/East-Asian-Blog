            <p class="h5 mt-3 mb-3 custom-paragraph-article">
              Shinrin-Yoku, meaning "forest bathing" in Japanese, appeared in
              the early 1980s thanks to the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture,
              Forestry, and Fisheries. However, the concept of immersing oneself
              in the healing energies of the forest dates back centuries, deeply
              rooted in Japan's cultural and spiritual heritage. Drawing
              inspiration from Shinto and Buddhist practices, Shinrin-Yoku
              emphasizes the belief in the interconnectedness of humans with
              nature, recognizing the therapeutic influence of natural
              environments on overall well-being.
